# Sex differences in deleterious mutational effects in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>: combining quantiative and population genetic insights

Welcome!

This page contains the code underlying analyses and figures presented in 'Sex differences in deleterious mutational effects in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>: combining quantiative and population genetic insights' (Ruzicka et al. 2021, <i>Genetics</i>).

The code is organised into text files 1-8, which approximately follow the order of the analyses presented in the manuscript. The text files are either R scripts (.R suffix) or UNIX scripts (.sh suffix). Reproducing analyses presented in the manuscript typically requires running both R and UNIX scripts. The contents of each file are described in bullet-point form below. I have also annotated the code for clarity, but if it's insufficiently clear please e-mail me at filip.ruzicka [at] monash.edu.

#### 1. GWAS of sex-specific fitness

#### 2. Functional analyses of candidate loci

#### 3. Polygenicity of fitness

#### 4. Partitioning Va

#### 5. Regression of effect size on MAF

#### 6. Alternative metrics of purifying selection

#### 7. Stationary distribution simulations

#### 8. Theoretical predictions
