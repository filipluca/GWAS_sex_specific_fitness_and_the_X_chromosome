# Sex and sex-linkage shape polygenic fitness variation in D. melanogaster

Welcome!

This github page contains the code underlying analyses and figures presented in 'Sex and sex-linkage shape polygenic fitness variation in D. melanogaster' (Ruzicka et al. XXXX).

The code is organised into text files X-X, which approximately follow the order of the analyses presented in the manuscript. The text files are usually a mixture of R and UNIX scripts. The contents of each file are described in bullet-point form below. I have also annotated the code for clarity, but if it's insufficiently clear please e-mail me at filip.ruzicka [at] monash.edu.

The Xth text file contains more detailed descriptions of the datafiles shared on zenodo (XXX). These zenodo datafiles contain the raw data used to produce the figures in the manuscript, and will be the most useful objects for future users.
