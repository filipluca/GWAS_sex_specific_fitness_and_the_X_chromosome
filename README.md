# Sex and sex-linkage shape polygenic fitness variation in D. melanogaster

Welcome!

This page contains the code underlying analyses and figures presented in 'Sex and sex-linkage shape polygenic fitness variation in D. melanogaster' (Ruzicka et al. XXXX).

The code is organised into text files 1-7, which approximately follow the order of the analyses presented in the manuscript. The text files are either R scripts (.R suffix) or UNIX scripts (.sh suffix). The contents of each file are described in bullet-point form below. I have also annotated the code for clarity, but if it's insufficiently clear please e-mail me at filip.ruzicka [at] monash.edu.

The 8th text file contains descriptions of the data files shared on zenodo (XXX). These zenodo data files contain raw data used to perform analyses and produce figures in the manuscript. They will be the most useful objects for future users.

#### 1. GWAS of sex-specific fitness

#### 2. Functional analyses of candidate loci

#### 3. Polygenicity of fitness

#### 4. Partitioning Va

#### 5. Regression of effect size on MAF

#### 6. Additional metrics of purifying selection

#### 7. Stationary distribution simulations

#### 8. Zenodo data file descriptions
