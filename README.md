# The effects of sex and sex-linkage on polygenic fitness variation in Drosophila melanogaster

Welcome!

This page contains the code underlying analyses and figures presented in 'The effects of sex and sex-linkage on polygenic fitness variation in Drosophila melanogaster' (Ruzicka et al. XXXX).

The code is organised into text files 1-8, which approximately follow the order of the analyses presented in the manuscript. The text files are either R scripts (.R suffix) or UNIX scripts (.sh suffix). Reproducing analyses presented in the manuscript typically requires running both R and UNIX scripts. The contents of each file are described in bullet-point form below. I have also annotated the code for clarity, but if it's insufficiently clear please e-mail me at filip.ruzicka [at] monash.edu.

The 9th text file contains descriptions of the data files shared on zenodo (TBD). These zenodo data files contain raw data used to perform analyses and produce figures in the manuscript. They will be the most useful objects for future users.

#### 1. GWAS of sex-specific fitness

#### 2. Functional analyses of candidate loci

#### 3. Polygenicity of fitness

#### 4. Partitioning Va

#### 5. Regression of effect size on MAF

#### 6. Alternative metrics of purifying selection

#### 7. Stationary distribution simulations

#### 8. Theoretical predictions

#### 9. Zenodo data file descriptions
